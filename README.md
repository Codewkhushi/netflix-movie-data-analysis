# Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Netflix movie data to uncover key insights about movie trends, content popularity, and other patterns using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, we explore a dataset containing details about Netflix movies, such as movie titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more. We focus on:
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and insights from the data.
- **Visualization**: Creating visually appealing charts and graphs to communicate the findings.
- **Insights & Conclusion**: Providing actionable insights and conclusions based on the analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used for interactive coding and running Python scripts in an easy-to-follow, notebook format.
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**:
   - Loading the Netflix dataset.
